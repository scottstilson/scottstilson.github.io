    <section>
        <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p>Anyone who wishes to follow Jesus, in groups small enough to fit in a house. <a href="">How come?</a></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <h3>A regular meal together</h3>
        <p>Call it the Lord’s supper, call it a love feast: We eat together every time we gather as a church. <a href="">Why?</a></p>
        <h3>at each church’s discretion: Singing, reading, praying, sharing, teaching, and planning good works</h3>
        <p>The frequency, formality, regularity, order, and mix of ministry elements vary from church to church. Some churches that’ll be listed here are fairly structured; others are very casual. The sole requirement is that everything be said and done with the ‘Why?’ below in mind.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p>Whatever time works best for a given group. <a href="">Find a church</a></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Where?</h2>
        <p>Houses usually. <a href="">How come?</a> <a href="">Find a church</a></p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>In remembrance of <b>Jesus</b> to encourage, equip, and provoke one another to <b>love</b> and <b>good deeds</b> like His and thus substantiate the <b>good news</b> that He, the crucified and resurrected one, is <b>lord</b>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <h3>full and open participation of all members</h3>
        <p>Everybody contributes to the building up of the body of Christ in love, just like the Scriptures say. No one voice dominates—except, hopefully, the voice of the Lord. <a href="">How does this work?</a></p>
        <h3>Consensus decision making</h3>
        <p>We work to discern the leading of the Holy Spirit by unanimity before making a decision. <a href="">Why?</a></p>
        <h3>unity in the essentials</h3>
        <p>Three words: Jesus is lord.</p>
        <h3>liberty in the nonessentials</h3>
        <p>Politics, eschatology, inerrancy, predestination, abortion, gay marriage, the mechanisms and scope of the Atonement, the Trinity—our opinions about these things are important. But they’re not crucial.</p>
        <p style="display:none"> When we disagree, we’ll talk about it if we think it’ll be edifying to do so but hold silent if  we don’t. When we teach, we do so in humility, submitting for others to judge as right or wrong. Whether we’re bearing good fruit is more important than any disagreement</p>
        <h3>charity in all things</h3>
        <p>“We may not think alike, but we can love alike” (Thomas Jay Oord). The ultimate heresy is unlove.</p>

    <hr>
    <aside>For some folks, it may be easiest to think of the churches that’ll be listed on this site as fully participatory life groups, cell groups, or small groups without a sponsoring or overseeing institutional church.</aside>
